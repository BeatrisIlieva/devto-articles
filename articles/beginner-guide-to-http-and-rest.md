## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

_When we talk about the web, we often use the terms â€˜Internetâ€™ and â€˜World Wide Webâ€™ interchangeably, but they refer to different things. The Internet is the vast global **network** that connects computers and devices, while the World Wide Web (WWW) is a **service** that runs on top of this network, allowing us to access websites and exchange information through HTTP._

`WWW` is a service on the Internet that enables the communication between a `Client` (such as a web Browser) and a `Server`. This interaction happens through `HTTP`, a **text-based protocol** that defines the rules for transferring web resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and fontsâ€”powering the web as we know it. Without following these rules, communication between the client and server would be unsuccessful.
