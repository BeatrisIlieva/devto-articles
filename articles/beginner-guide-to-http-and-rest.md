## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

_When we talk about the web, we often use the terms â€˜Internetâ€™ and â€˜World Wide Webâ€™ interchangeably, but they refer to different things. The Internet is the vast global network that connects computers and devices, while the World Wide Web (WWW) is a service that runs on top of this network, allowing us to access websites and exchange information through HTTP._

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a service on the Internet that enables communication between a Client (such as a web browser) and a Server. This interaction happens through HTTP, a text-based protocol that defines the rules for transferring web resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, images, and fontsâ€”powering the web as we know it. Without following these rules, communication between the client and server would fail.

Regardless of the backend or frontend technology we use, we must always follow HTTP rules to make requests from the client and send responses from the server.

To put it simply, HTTP is a text-based protocol that defines how communication between a client and a server occurs through the WWW service. The goal is to transfer web resourcesâ€”such as JSON, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, and moreâ€”between the client and the server.

HTTP operates on a request-response model. The client initiates the communication by making a request, and the server responds. Each request has only one corresponding response.

## Web Client and Web Server

A Web Client is software that interacts with a web server. The most common web client is a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

A Web Server is software that listens for incoming requests on a specific port. It processes these requests and returns an appropriate response to the client. The server runs continuously awaiting requests.

Together, the web client and web server communicate to deliver content and functionality on the web.
