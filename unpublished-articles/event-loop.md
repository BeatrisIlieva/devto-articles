## Step-by-Step Explanation of the JavaScript Event Loop Execution

For better visualization, all synchronous execution contexts are pushed onto the call stack, ready to be executed. The Execution Stack (Call Stack) is where synchronous code runs on the main thread.

üöÄ console.log('Start'); is executed immediately, producing "Start" as output.

‚è∏Ô∏è The Event Loop is paused while synchronous code runs in the main thread.

‚è≥ The setTimeout(() => { zeroSecondsLater(); }, 0); function is asynchronous.

üîÑ The JavaScript engine delegates it to the Browser API.

üì© Since the delay is 0ms, the Browser API processes the request immediately and moves the zeroSecondsLater callback to the event queue.

üîÑ setTimeout(() => { console.log('3 seconds later'); }, 3000); is delegated to the Browser API, which starts a 3-second timer.

‚è≥  Similarly, setTimeout(() => { console.log('4 seconds later'); }, 4000); is delegated to the Browser API, which starts a 4-second timer.

‚è© Meanwhile, synchronous code continues executing in the main thread without waiting for these timers.
