A request to the backend is an asynchronous operation. When we send a request to the backend to fetch content from a database, we have no control over how long it will take to process. The backend first receives the request, processes it, queries the database, processes the retrieved data, and only then returns a response. The total time required depends on various factors, such as server load, network congestion, and internet speed.

In some cases, the process may take a few seconds, which is a long time in the context of software applications. If users are forced to wait without being able to interact with the application, it results in a poor user experienceâ€”such as a frozen screen until the response arrives.

This is where asynchronous programming comes into play. It allows the code to continue executing normally while the request is processed in the background. Once the request is complete, the result is displayed without interrupting the user experience.

## Multi-Threaded vs Single-Threaded in JavaScript

**Before you continue, you might want to read [Understanding the Event Loop: The Heart of Asynchronous JavaScript](https://dev.to/beatrisilieva/a-beginners-guide-to-http-and-rest-services-3j92).**

In general, multi-threaded means that multiple processes can run simultaneously, with two programs executing in parallel, independently of each other. On the other hand, synchronous code runs sequentially, within a single process.

JS, however, is a single-threaded language, meaning it executes code in one process at a time. But hereâ€™s the interesting part: despite being single-threaded, JS allows asynchronous operations. This means that even though JS processes tasks one at a time, it can still handle tasks like network requests, allowing other code to run in the meantime.

So, how can JS be asynchronous if itâ€™s not multi-threaded? The key lies in the event loop mechanism, which lets JS offload tasks to be executed later, without blocking the main thread. This gives the illusion of parallel execution while maintaining a single thread of execution.
